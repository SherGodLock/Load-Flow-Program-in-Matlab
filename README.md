# Load-Flow-Program-in-Matlab
The load flow programs are developed in MATLAB. Altogether there are 4 programs. The list of the programs are: 
1. Forming Ybus Matrix
2. Gauss- Seidel Load Flow
3. Solving Nonlinear Equations using Newton- Raphson
4. Newton - Raphson Load Flow


These program are not general. The data is used are the examples of the textbook.
